Four prompts a careholder can run through a deep-research AI to see where their [[bioregion|bioregion]] still runs on the [[economy|Economy]] and where the shortest paths to funding [[retention-economics|retention]] work are. Written for someone who has read the orientation essays and wants a fast, useful answer before committing to the [[templates/index|four-template founding suite]].

## Overview

The four templates in the founding suite produce the documents a [[biohub|BioHub]] uses to establish itself. That work takes weeks. Before running it, a coordinator often needs a faster read: where does the bioregion currently leak value into the Economy, and where could it earn its first retention-linked revenue.

These four prompts produce that read in an afternoon. Attach the project documents you already hold. Planning documents, ecological or hydrological surveys, existing partnership summaries, cohort notes: anything that describes the bioregion in specific terms. Point the AI at https://wiki.bioconomy.earth. Run the prompts in order. Each prompt builds on the AI's answer to the previous one.

The prompts assume a reader who has read [[essays/what-is-a-biohub|What Is a BioHub]], [[essays/what-is-a-bioregion|What Is a BioRegion]], and [[essays/what-is-a-bioconomy|What Is a BioConomy]]. They do not assume any prior work in the templates suite.

## Prompt 1. Where the bioregion still runs on the Economy

Diagnostic. Names five specific dependencies on Economy logic.

```
I am coordinating a BioHub in [BIOREGION NAME]. The attached documents describe the region's current productive activity, the actors involved, and where value flows.

Using https://wiki.bioconomy.earth/essays/what-is-a-bioconomy and https://wiki.bioconomy.earth/glossary/throughput-economics as the reference frame, list five specific ways this bioregion's current economy runs on Economy logic. For each item, name the activity, the dependency the activity carries, and the external party that captures the value the activity produces.

Be concrete. Prefer named commodities, named institutions, and named commodity chains over general categories.
```

## Prompt 2. Where the dependency would fail first

Fragility diagnosis. Turns the five dependencies into a ranked list of what breaks first when Economy conditions shift.

```
Take the five dependencies from your previous answer. For each, name the specific point at which a disruption in the Economy would cause the activity to fail first: a commodity-price shift, a regulatory change, a supply-chain interruption, a capital-market shift, a labor-market shift, or a comparable external condition.

Then, for each, describe what the bioregion would have to build to hold the function locally under retention logic. Reference https://wiki.bioconomy.earth/concepts/retention-logic and https://wiki.bioconomy.earth/glossary/retention-economics.
```

## Prompt 3. The three services the bioregion can tender fastest

Positive read. Identifies the three services the bioregion is closest to being able to offer external counterparties.

```
Using the attached project documents and https://wiki.bioconomy.earth/glossary/tenderable-services-portfolio, identify the three services from the six-service portfolio (water yield, carbon sequestration, biodiversity data, heritage and tourism, food systems, coordination-as-employment) that this bioregion could tender to external counterparties fastest.

For each service, name the specific asset base already present in the bioregion, the coordination work still needed to make the service tenderable, and the retention outcome the service delivers.
```

## Prompt 4. Plausible short-term funding counterparties

Actionable list. Names five counterparties that could purchase or fund one of the three services within twelve months.

```
For the three services from your previous answer, using https://wiki.bioconomy.earth/research/corporate-partnerships-protected-areas and https://wiki.bioconomy.earth/frameworks/five-transvestment-pathways, name five plausible counterparties reachable from this bioregion (corporate stewardship funds, water utilities, PES buyers, biodiversity credit purchasers, patrons operating on the mycelial patronage pattern, or comparable) that could purchase or fund one of the three services within twelve months.

For each counterparty, name the specific service they would purchase, the closest reachable point of contact, and the readiness of the service under https://wiki.bioconomy.earth/glossary/readiness-diagnostic (contractable now, contractable after specified build-out, or speculative pending research).
```

## Running the prompts

Any deep-research AI platform will do. ChatGPT Deep Research, Claude Research, Perplexity Deep Research, Gemini Deep Research, or an equivalent. The prompts assume the platform can fetch URLs and read attached documents in the same session.

Attach the project documents once, at the start. The four prompts refer back to them.

Between prompts, read what the AI produced. Where an answer names something you know is wrong (a counterparty that has already refused an approach, an asset that no longer exists, a service the cohort has decided not to offer), tell the AI in your next prompt what it got wrong and ask it to redo the answer. The AI cannot know local ground truth that no public source describes.

The answers to the four prompts are not a plan. They are the initial read. The [[templates/index|four-template founding suite]] is where a cohort converts that read into standing documents a BioHub can act on.

## What this page is not

- **Not a substitute for the founding suite**. A BioHub whose only documentation is the output of these four prompts will not withstand scrutiny from counterparties.
- **Not a substitute for cohort work**. The prompts run in an afternoon. The founding work takes months. Both are required.
- **Not a fixed set**. A coordinator who reads the answers and finds a specific question that matters more than the ones the prompts ask should ask it. The four prompts are the shortest set that reliably surfaces the two questions most bioregions need answered first.

## Provenance

Written 27 August 2026 for the "AI Quick-engage" section of the wiki's index page. The four prompts are constructed from the wiki's existing operational vocabulary (retention logic, the tenderable services portfolio, the readiness diagnostic, and the [[content/glossary/t-z/transvestment|transvestment]] pathways) and from the corporate-partnerships-protected-areas research brief. The prompts have not yet been run against a real BioHub. The first coordinator to run them is invited to feed the outputs back so the phrasing can be tuned.
