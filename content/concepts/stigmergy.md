Indirect coordination in which traces left by one agent's activity in a shared environment stimulate further activity by the same or other agents. The traces do the work of communication. No agent needs to hold the whole plan; each responds to what the environment shows.

The term was coined by the French zoologist [[grasse-pierre-paul|Pierre-Paul Grassé]] in 1959, from Greek *stigma* (mark) and *ergon* (work), to describe how termites build complex mounds without central direction. Each termite deposits a pheromone-marked pellet, the deposit changes the local field, and the changed field triggers the next termite's action. Ant pheromone trails, bee comb construction, and slime-mould foraging all operate this way.

[[heylighen-francis|Francis Heylighen]] and others at the Free University of Brussels extended the concept to human coordination in the early 2000s. Wikipedia, open-source software, and the open commons more broadly operate stigmergically. A contributor sees the current state of the shared artifact, adds what the state calls for, and leaves the modified state for the next contributor. The shared substrate carries the coordination.

Two variants are usually distinguished. *Quantitative stigmergy* uses continuous gradient signals (a pheromone concentration, a page-edit count, an issue-tracker priority score). *Qualitative stigmergy* uses discrete triggers where a threshold shape or structural feature releases a different class of action (a mound wall reaching a certain height triggers a new construction stage; a git branch reaching a certain state triggers a merge review).

## Relevance to the BioConomy

Stigmergy is one of the mechanisms through which [[content/glossary/m-s/mycelial-coordination|Mycelial Coordination]] operates. The [[content/concepts/substrate-hypothesis|Substrate Hypothesis]] states that coordination is a property of the substrate. Stigmergy names a specific class of substrate-produced coordination that BioConomy design relies on.

Several BioConomy instruments are stigmergic by design.

The [[bioscore|BioScore]] and other composite substrate-health indicators are quantitative stigmergic signals. As one [[biohub|BioHub]]'s score moves, others adjust their activity in response, without direct instruction from a central body. The score is the trace; the trace pulls the next action.

The [[tenderable-services-portfolio|Tenderable Services Portfolio]] is a stigmergic marker in a market environment. A verified ecological yield entered into the portfolio makes visible what buyers will pay for, and other bioregions read the marker and can enter the market on the same terms.

The Templates ([[templates/biohub-identity-template|BioHub Identity Template]], [[templates/bioregion-establishment-template|BioRegion Establishment Template]], and the others) work as qualitative stigmergic triggers. A BioHub that has completed the identity template signals a readiness state to the federation, and that state releases the next class of coordination that becomes available to it.

Retention-accounting frames are stigmergic as well. They make visible what conventional GDP accounting keeps invisible, and that visibility pulls capital and labor toward the substrate they otherwise draw down.

## Provenance

Written 4 September 2026. Stigmergy names a mechanism the BioConomy corpus has been assuming without naming: substrate-mediated coordination in which changes to the shared environment carry the coordination load. This entry places the term in its biological origin, its extension to human coordination, and its specific application to the BioConomy instruments (BioScore, Tenderable Services Portfolio, the Templates, retention accounting) that operate stigmergically.
